# Surfs_Up

## Project Overview
This project was created to determine the viability of a proposed ice cream and surf shop on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. The objective is to determine how the business would be impacted by the weather, especially the difference in potential business in the summer vs the winter.

## Resources
- Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
- Software: Python 3.9.12, Visual Studio Code 1.69.2, Jupyter Notebook

## Results
There are three main differences between the weather data collected in June and in December.
- As one might expect, the average temperature in June is higher than in December. In this case, the difference is only 3.9 degrees (F).
- The standard deviation for the month of December was larger than that of June by 0.488, meaning there is a greater variance in temperatures throughout the month of December than June.
- While the maximum temperatures for both months are very close, the minimum temperatures are a bigger difference. The maximum differed by only 2 degrees, and the minimum by 8. 

## Challenge Summary
Because the differences between the temperature data collected for June and December are not dramatic, they are informative. The island of Oahu has mostly fair temperature, regardless of time of year. This is a very good sign for the viablility of the proposed business. 
Further analysis would be useful, namely on the precipitation data for each month.
